# Swiper 0.6

Swiper is a simple tile-swiping tvOS game.  It is/was a side project for me
to learn more about UIKit as applied to the tvOS interface, SceneKit, Swift,
storyboards, and a few other technologies I don't get the chance to use in
my day job.

The basic game engine works and is unit-tested.  There are currently 3 game
modes, easy, intermediate, and hard that vary the number of tiles the user
is required to move.

There is also support for selecting a "theme", or set of pictures that the
game picks from at random.  This was intended to be walled used as an in-app
purchase mechanism to make money.

Building a house/life got in the way of me finishing this project in a timely
manner, so I'm putting it on github in case anyone else finds the methods and
techniques used to build a tile-swiping game useful.

The source is all freely available under the MIT license.  All I ask is that you
let me know if you use it in a commercial setting.
